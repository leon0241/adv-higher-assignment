   // Other methods
   incrementWordErrors - adds 1 to wordErrors
   incrementWordCount - adds 1 to userWordCount
   incrementCharacters - checks if character is valid and adds 1 if so
   editGameData - change the type and length of the game
   initialiseArray - constructs the gameWords array as a random 50 of the top 200 words
   newWord - appends a new word to the array

   timeTimer - timer for a timed game
   wordTimer - timer for a word game
   goToTimedGame - callback function for timed game
   goToWordGame - callback function for word game
   goToNextWord - methods that are called once a word has been typed

// Class with methods that update the DOM
DOMManipulation
   // Constructor method
   var int position - how far a word is down a line
   var arr nodeList - list of all word elements in the DOM
   var element area - DOM element that the words are in

   // Getter methods

   get area

   // Setter methods
   set position

   // Other methods
   updateNodeList - updates the node list
